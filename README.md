# CUDA Seedfinder
This Seedfinder is written in 100% CUDA and runs fully parallel.

At this very moment in time it has basic structure finding on structure seeds.
Additionally, structure seeds don't guarantee an actual structure spawn but rather structure position.

## Future
Implementing full structure coverage, starting at Ruined Portal.
