# CUDA Seedfinder
This Seedfinder is written in 100% CUDA and runs fully parallel.

At this very moment in time it has basic structure finding on structure seeds. Please Note that there are quite a few edge cases that are not implemented yet.
Additionally, structure seeds don't guarantee an actual structure spawn but rather structure position.

## Future
The plans are implementing the edge cases for structure spawns and then implement full structure coverage starting at the ruined portal.
